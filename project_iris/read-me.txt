#  The Iris Dataset has a long history, dating from 1936 when Edgar Anderson collected the data and published a paper describing it.
#  Also in 1936, Ronald Fisher used linear discriminant analysis to analyze the data and build a model of it.  
#  This link takes you to the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

#  The data consists of 150 data points, 50 each from a single flower.
#  The three species are Iris-setosa, Iris-verscolor, Iris-virginica.

#  There are four measurements from each flower:
#    sepal-length
#    sepal-width  
#    petal-length
#    petal-width

#  The species of each flower has been identified by an expert botanist.
#  This is an example of supervised learning.

#  A common theme in machine learning is to begin with inspection of the data.
#  To that end, this tutorial begins by showing the results of several metrics
#  of the data and several visual presentations of its properties.

#  Several visual libraries are illustrated.
#  The first set of plots are made using the plot methods of matplotlib and pandas.
#  Then matplotlib (using the inline option), and finally seaborn.

#  As you will see in the charts displayed in the brief-Intro-python, one of the species is easily identified.  
#  Since we can draw a straight line separating it from the others, 
#  the data is linearly separable. 
#  The other two have overlapping data distributions and are not
#  linearly separable.
